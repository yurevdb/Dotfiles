# Dotfiles

## Usage

I'm a windows user (mainly for easy gaming and .Net development) but really enjoy using linux for it's terminal and customizability. 
The ease of custumization on linux still baffles me, but at least with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL for short) that customizability has, sort of, come to windows.
It's only the terminal, but let's be faire, that's the most important feature with regards to development use.

These are the most current configuration files I use for WSL Ubuntu on windows. I use Z Shell, Neovim and Tmux to create a fully featured terminal experience on a windows machine.

All the config files are hard linked into a Dotfiles folder for synchronization with git.
To use these configuration files just hardlink them to the correct folders (will be explained later on).
